# ERC20Forwarder Contract

The ERC20 forwarder contract written in Solidity enabling ERC20 token wrapping and unwrapping on the [Anoma EVM protocol adapter](https://github.com/anoma/pa-evm).

## Prerequisites

1. Get an up-to-date version of [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) with

   ```sh
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
   foundryup
   ```

2. Optionally, to lint the contracts, install [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) using a JS package manager such as [Bun](https://bun.com/) with

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | sh
   bun install
   ```

3. Optionally, for static analysis, install [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) with

   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install slither-analyzer
   ```

   or brew

   ```sh
   brew install slither-analyzer
   ```

## Usage

#### Installation

Change the directory to the `contracts` folder with `cd contracts` and run

```sh
forge soldeer install
```

#### Build

To compile the contracts, run

```sh
forge build
```

#### Tests & Coverage

To run the tests, run

```sh
forge test
```

To show the coverage report, run

```sh
forge coverage
```

Append the

- `--no-match-coverage "(script|test)"` to exclude scripts, tests, and drafts,
- `--report lcov` to generate the `lcov.info` file that can be used by code review tooling.

#### Linting & Static Analysis

As a prerequisite, install the

- `solhint` linter (see https://github.com/protofire/solhint)
- `slither` static analyzer (see https://github.com/crytic/slither)

To run the linter and static analyzer, run

```sh
bunx solhint --config .solhint.json 'src/**/*.sol' && \
bunx solhint --config .solhint.other.json 'script/**/*.sol' 'test/**/*.sol' && \
slither .
```

#### Rust Bindings

To regenerate the Rust bindings (see the [forge bind](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/bind/) documentation), run

```sh
forge bind \
  --select '^(ERC20Forwarder)$' \
  --bindings-path ../bindings/src/generated/ \
  --module \
  --overwrite
```

#### Documentation

Run

```sh
forge doc
```

#### Deployment

To simulate deployment on sepolia, run

```sh
forge script script/DeployERC20Forwarder.s.sol:DeployERC20Forwarder \
  --sig "run(bool,address,bytes32,address)" <IS_TEST_DEPLOYMENT> <PROTOCOL_ADAPTER> <CARRIER_LOGIC_REF> <EMERGENCY_COMMITTEE> \
  --rpc-url sepolia
```

Append the

- `--broadcast` flag to deploy to the network
- `--verify` flag for subsequent contract verification (https://sourcify.dev/ by default, Etherscan if an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable is set)
- `--account <ACCOUNT_NAME>` flag to use a previously imported keystore (see `cast wallet --help` for more info)

#### Block Explorer Verification

For post-deployment verification on Etherscan run

```sh
forge verify-contract \
   <ADDRESS> \
   src/ERC20Forwarder.sol:ERC20Forwarder \
   --chain sepolia
```

after replacing `<ADDRESS>` with the respective contract address.
